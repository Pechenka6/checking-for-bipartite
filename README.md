### Checking-for-bipartite
An algorithm for checking the graph for bipartite.
The graph is defined by the adjacency matrix.
Example of an input file:
```input.txt
4
0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1
1 0 0 1
0 1 1 0

If the graph is bipartite, and vertices that can be contained in 1 group are output.
Output to a file:
```output.txt
YES
1 2 3
